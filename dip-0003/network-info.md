# Appendix C: Network Information

## Legacy Format

### Masternode Information

The fields below are represented as `networkInfo` and are applicable to all masternodes types as defined in
[Appendix B](masternode-types.md)

| Field     | Type    | Size | Description                                                                |
| --------- | ------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ipAddress | byte[]  | 16   | IPv6 address in network byte order. Only IPv4 mapped addresses are allowed |
| port      | uint_16 | 2    | Port (network byte order)                                                  |

#### <a name="mninfo_rules">Validation Rules</a>

Network information is invalid if any of these conditions are true:

  1. `ipAddress` is set and `port` is not set to the default mainnet port
  2. `ipAddress` is set and not routable or not an IPv4 mapped address
  3. `ipAddress` is set and already used in the registered masternodes set

### Platform Information

The fields below are represented as `platformInfo` and are only applicable for EvoNodes (type 1).

| Field            | Type    | Size   | Description                                                                              |

Platform information is invalid if any of these conditions are true:

  1. `platformP2PPort`, `platformHTTPPort` and [masternode information](#masternode-information) fields are not distinct
  2. `platformP2PPort` and `platformHTTPPort` aren't valid port values [1, 65535]
  3. For mainnet evonodes, `platformP2PPort` and `platformHTTPPort` aren't set to the default values
    1. Default Platform P2P port: 26656
    2. Default Platform HTTP port: 443

* This field MUST be ignored for connecting to [`entry.address`](#entryaddress-field) of [`entry.type`](#entrytype-field)
  where ports are immaterial.

## Extensions

Extensions are supported types of addresses that are beyond the types enumerated in BIP 155. Their network IDs are defined
in the [`entry.type`](#entrytype-field) extensions table.

### Extension A: Internet domain names

Domain names resolved by DNS on the globally routed internet have the following [`entry.address`](#entryaddress-field) structure

| Field   | Type   | Size     | Description                                                     |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| size    | uint_8 | 1        | Length of the domain name in bytes                              |
| name    | byte[] | variable | Domain name encoded in US-ASCII                                 |

DNS records for a domain name MUST have a valid `A` or `AAAA` entry.

#### `size` field

* This field MUST hold a value of at least 4
* This field MUST NOT hold a value greater than 253 pursuant to [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.4),
  taking into consideration the leading and trailing bytes as specified in [Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.1)

#### `name` field

* This field MUST only permit letters, digits and a hyphen (`-`) in each label pursuant to
  [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.1).
  * A label is defined as a string of 63 characters or less beginning with a letter and ending with a letter or number
    separated by the period (`.`) delimiter.
* This field MUST NOT permit upper-case letters despite being permitted by RFC 1035 in light of its case-insensitivity.
* This field MUST have a string containing at least two labels separated by the specified delimiter.
  * "Dotless domains" (as described by [RFC 7085](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7085#section-2)) MUST NOT be
    permitted.
